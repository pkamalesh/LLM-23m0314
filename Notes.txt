Machine Learning (ML)

A subset of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on building systems that can learn from data and improve performance over time without being explicitly programmed.
Types of ML:

Supervised Learning:
 The model learns from labeled data, making predictions based on input-output pairs. Examples include classification and regression.
Unsupervised Learning: The model learns from unlabeled data, identifying patterns and structures. Examples include clustering and dimensionality reduction.
Reinforcement Learning: The model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties. Itâ€™s used in areas like robotics and game playing.
Semi-supervised Learning: Combines a small amount of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data during training.
Self-supervised Learning: A form of supervised learning where the model creates its own labels by using input data to generate a supervisory signal.
Key Concepts:

Training Data: Data used to train the model.
Validation Data: Data used to tune model parameters.
Testing Data: Data used to evaluate the final model's performance.
Overfitting & Underfitting: Overfitting occurs when the model is too complex, capturing noise rather than the signal in the data. Underfitting happens when the model is too simple to capture the underlying pattern.

Common Algorithms:

Linear Regression: For predicting continuous values.
Logistic Regression: For binary classification.
Decision Trees & Random Forests: For both classification and regression.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): For classification tasks.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): For both classification and regression.
Neural Networks: The foundation for deep learning.

Deep Learning (DL)

A subset of machine learning focused on algorithms called neural networks that attempt to simulate the behavior of the human brain to recognize patterns, learn from data, and make decisions.
Key Concepts:

Neural Networks: Composed of layers of neurons, where each neuron receives inputs, processes them, and passes the result to the next layer.
Activation Functions: Functions like ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh used to introduce non-linearity into the network.
Backpropagation: The process of updating the weights in the neural network by propagating the error backward through the network.
Optimization: Techniques like Gradient Descent used to minimize the loss function.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Specialized for processing grid-like data such as images.
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Specialized for sequential data like time series or text.

Deep Learning Frameworks:

TensorFlow: Developed by Google, widely used in both research and industry.
PyTorch: Developed by Facebook, known for its flexibility and ease of use, popular in academia.
Keras: High-level API for building and training deep learning models, often used with TensorFlow as a backend.

Natural Language Processing (NLP)

A field of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. The goal is to enable machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language.
Key Tasks in NLP:

Text Classification: Assigning categories to text (e.g., sentiment analysis, spam detection).
Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying and classifying entities in text (e.g., names of people, organizations).
Machine Translation: Translating text from one language to another.
Speech Recognition: Converting spoken language into text.
Part-of-Speech Tagging: Labeling each word in a sentence with its part of speech (e.g., noun, verb).
Language Modeling: Predicting the next word in a sequence, crucial for tasks like text generation.
Key Techniques:

Bag of Words (BoW): A representation of text that counts the occurrence of each word in a document.
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): A statistical measure to evaluate the importance of a word in a document relative to a corpus.
Word Embeddings: Dense vector representations of words that capture semantic meaning, such as Word2Vec and GloVe.
Sequence-to-Sequence Models (Seq2Seq): Often used in tasks like translation, where an input sequence is transformed into an output sequence.

Large Language Models (LLMs)

LLMs are a type of deep learning model, typically based on transformers, trained on vast amounts of text data to perform various NLP tasks. They are designed to generate human-like text based on the input they receive.

Key Models:

GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer): A model that generates text in a human-like manner, trained on a diverse range of internet text.
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers): A model designed for understanding the context of words in a sentence, crucial for tasks like question answering.
T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer): A model that treats every NLP task as a text-to-text task, facilitating a uniform approach to different NLP problems.
ChatGPT: A conversational AI based on the GPT architecture, designed to interact with users in a more natural, dialog-based format.
Key Concepts:

Transformer Architecture: The foundation for many LLMs, it uses self-attention mechanisms to process input data in parallel, making it more efficient and scalable for large datasets.
Pretraining and Fine-tuning: LLMs are often pretrained on a large corpus of text and then fine-tuned on specific tasks to improve performance.
Zero-shot, Few-shot, and Transfer Learning: Techniques that allow LLMs to perform tasks with little or no task-specific data.

Some Applications:

Content Generation: Generating articles, stories, and even code.
Conversational Agents: Powering chatbots and virtual assistants.
Text Summarization: Condensing long articles into short summaries.
Language Translation: Translating text between different languages.
Code Generation: Assisting in writing and debugging code.
